# Image_Enhancement



This project implements a deep learning model for image super-resolution and enhancement using the IRBNet architecture, which incorporates Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks for improved performance.

ðŸš€ Features
Developed a convolutional neural network based on the IRBNet architecture for enhancing image resolution.

Trained on paired high-resolution and low-resolution images using TensorFlow.

Evaluated model performance using PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) metrics.

ðŸ§  Technologies
Python, TensorFlow

Deep Learning, Super-Resolution
